# Multi-Modal Fake News Detection

A prototype system for detecting real vs. fake news by combining text, image and video analysis in a single pipeline. Built in Google Colab (and runnable locally), it ingests URLs or local files‚ÄîInstagram posts, YouTube links, web articles, images and videos‚Äîextracts content automatically, and issues real-time ‚ÄúREAL‚Äù / ‚ÄúFAKE‚Äù predictions via two complementary inference engines:  

1. **PyTorch Classifier**  
   - Text: DistilBERT tokenizer + encoder  
   - Images: fine-tuned ResNet-18 backbone  
   - Video: R3D-18 3D-CNN feature extractor  
   - Fusion: concatenation of modality embeddings + final FC head  

2. **LLM Second Opinion**  
   - Prompts routed to Google‚Äôs Gemini 1.5 Flash via LangChain  
   - Returns a binary decision plus a natural-language rationale
